Caesar Cipher – Tutorial Project
This is a beginner-friendly tutorial project that demonstrates how the Caesar Cipher encryption technique works using Python.

 What is the Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption algorithm used to shift each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It's one of the simplest and oldest forms of encryption.

Project Overview
This script allows users to:

Encrypt messages using a key (1–26)

Decrypt messages with the correct key

Learn how basic substitution ciphers work

It features:

Simple and clear Python code

Support for both encryption and decryption

A CLI (Command Line Interface) for user interaction

How to Use
Run the file:
python Caeser_Cipher.py

Choose:
Type e to encrypt or d to decrypt.

Enter a number (1–26) as the key.

Type your message.

Get the result!

This project was built as a tutorial exercise to help beginners understand how basic encryption works in practice. It's also a great starting point for anyone new to Python and interested in cybersecurity or cryptography.
